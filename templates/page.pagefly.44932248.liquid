<br>If you use features made available on our Site or Database by a third party social media site, your personally identifiable information may be collected or shared by us or by the third party. We consider information collected or shared through any such social media features as public information because the third party social media sites made it publicly available. If you do not want us to be able to access information about you from Third Party Sites, you must instruct the Third Party Sites not to share the information with us. True Sons does not control how these third parties use information collected from or about you, so be sure to review the privacy policies and privacy settings on your social media sites to make sure you understand the information they are sharing. If you do not want a Third Party Site to share information about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt out of sharing such information. We do identify any areas on the Site where third parties share information about you.
<br>
<br>We use features on third party social media sites that allow you to express opinions about products, services, or your interests and purchase our products.

You can avoid such collection and use of your personally identifiable information by declining to buy products through Third Party Sites or to express your views on Third Party Sites. Third Party Sites may also give you the option to limit such data collection and disclosure in the privacy settings on their sites. True Sons reserves its right not to display your personally identifiable information or content on our social media accounts and Site, even if you express an opinion about our products or services or consent to our use of such information or content.

You must first send us a notice of your complaint that includes a written statement of your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to your complaint, and the relief you are requesting (the “Dispute Notice”). The Dispute Notice must be addressed to: True Sons Grooming, Inc., 174 W. 4th St., New York, NY 10014 and sent by certified mail as described in Section 22 of the Site’s Terms of Use. If you do not reach an agreement with us to resolve your privacy complaint within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you may commence an arbitration proceeding under Section 22 of the Site’s Terms of Use.<br></span></p><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-oTLFK lcHmGL pf-d902caab"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-ptSuy fnmilh pf-2cb23b0b">13.
