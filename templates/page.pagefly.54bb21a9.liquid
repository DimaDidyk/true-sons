If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
<br>
<br>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without True Sons’ prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. True Sons may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
<br>
<br>Any notices or other communications provided by True Sons under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) by True Sons via email; or (ii) by posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
<br>
<br>True Sons’ failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of True Sons. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
